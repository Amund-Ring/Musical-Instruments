# Musical Instruments App üé∂

This project is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that displays a collection of musical instruments grouped into categories. Users can browse different categories, view instruments, and explore detailed descriptions and images of each instrument. The app reads and parses data from a local JSON file to dynamically populate the interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

### 1. **SwiftUI Framework**
- **Multi-Screen Navigation**: Utilized `NavigationView`, `NavigationLink`, and `ScrollView` for smooth and intuitive navigation between categories and instrument details.
- **List and Grid Layouts**: Displayed categories in a vertical list using custom rows (`CategoryListRow`) and instruments in a grid (`LazyVGrid`) within their respective categories.
- **UI Components**: Created reusable components with SwiftUI views such as `Text`, `Image`, `VStack`, `HStack`, and implemented `LazyVGrid` for flexible layouts.

### 2. **JSON Parsing (Codable)**
- Implemented data parsing using Swift's `Codable` protocol to read and decode local JSON data.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Populated categories and instruments dynamically by reading structured JSON data from a local file, making the app easy to scale with new data.
  
### 3. **Separation of Concerns**
- Created a `DataService` class to handle data loading from JSON, adhering to best practices in software design, improving code modularity, and reusability.

### 4. **State Management**
- Utilized SwiftUI's `@State` to manage data dynamically and update the UI in real-time when the data is loaded.
  
### 5. **Custom UI Design**
- Designed custom UI components like the `CategoryListRow` and `InstrumentListView` using SwiftUI‚Äôs declarative syntax.
- Applied styling and layout techniques such as `cornerRadius`, `padding`, `shadow`, and `background` to create a visually appealing app.
- **Custom Font Styling**: Implemented custom fonts and weights, including `.system(.title, design: .rounded)` and `.system(size: 32, design: .rounded)` to enhance the visual aesthetics.

### 6. **Error Handling**
- Integrated error handling in JSON decoding, providing fallback mechanisms to ensure the app does not crash when there are issues with data loading.

### 7. **Reusable Components**
- Created reusable SwiftUI views like `CategoryListRow` and `DetailView` to maintain modularity and allow for easy maintenance and scaling.

### 8. **Visual Previews**
- Used `#Preview` in SwiftUI to dynamically preview and test UI elements within Xcode, ensuring fast and efficient design iterations.

## üìö Features

- **Category-Based Navigation**: Users can browse musical instruments categorized by type (e.g., String Instruments, Percussion Instruments).
- **Instrument Detail Views**: Each instrument has its own dedicated view with an image, name, and detailed description.
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

## üöÄ Project Structure

- **Model Layer**: Defines `Category` and `Instrument` as `Codable` structs for JSON parsing.
- **Data Layer**: `DataService.swift` handles reading and parsing of the `InstrumentsData.json` file.
- **UI Layer**: 
    - `CategoryListView`: Displays a list of categories.
    - `InstrumentListView`: Displays instruments in a selected category using a grid.
    - `DetailView`: Shows detailed information about an individual instrument.

## üèÖ Key Takeaways

This project showcases core iOS development skills using SwiftUI, including state management, JSON data handling, and modular design principles. While the app is simple, it demonstrates effective data-driven UI, reusable components, and dynamic content rendering, laying the foundation for building more complex and feature-rich applications.
